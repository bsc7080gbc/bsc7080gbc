*MyShelf is a dynamic GenAI utility designed to enhance personal organization. It allows users to track reminders, store memories, manage ad-hoc information, and create categorized shopping lists. Simplification of what is required was the goal: ChatGPT + GitHub. Instructions have been provided to walk you through and explain the purpose and setup. I have also provided some historical versions as well so you can see how I matured the solution to where it is today.
.
In short, think "Jarvis" ...but on a budget.*

*Generate/convert content that feels less robotic. Then run it through a Detector (also provided) to see how you did.*


[**Context is Everything**](https://github.com/bsc7080gbc/genai_core_prompt):  


![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/bsc7080gbc/genai_core_prompt?style=social)

*Effective use of prompt frameworks, prompt techniques (CoT, ToT, SoT, etc), prompt engineering structures, feedback mechanisms, validation mechanisms, and other important elements providing context to our inquiries - these plus iteration - we can discover a significant decrease in so called hallucinations. When provided only a few possible lanes of travel, we greatly influence the potential of a correct response.*


[**Oracle PL/SQL - Dynamic SQL**](https://github.com/bsc7080gbc/plsql-dynamicsql-engine):  


![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/bsc7080gbc/plsql-dynamicsql-engine?style=social)

*This goes way back but represents one of the more challenging projects I worked on. I learned a lot. Full whitepaper and presentation deck with sourcecode.  Goes back to when the analytical functions "lead" and "lag" first came out. I was fascinated how these changed everything.*
