## 📂 Featured Projects

[**Project MyShelf**](https://github.com/bsc7080gbc/genai_prompt_myshelf):

![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/bsc7080gbc/genai_prompt_myshelf?style=social)

*MyShelf is a dynamic GenAI utility designed to enhance personal organization. It allows users to track reminders, store memories, manage ad-hoc information, and create categorized shopping lists. Simplification of what is required was the goal: ChatGPT + GitHub. Instructions have been provided to walk you through and explain the purpose and setup. I have also provided some historical versions as well so you can see how I matured the solution to where it is today.
.
In short, think "Jarvis" ...but on a budget.*
